        Until recently, I also hadn't setup an official
        performance budget and enforced it. This isnâ€™t to say that
        I never did performance audits. I frequently use tools
        like PageSpeed Insights and take the feedback to make improvements.
        But what I had never done was set a list of metrics that I needed
        the site to meet, and enforce them using some automated tool.
